# Timebanks
> Author: [Dawn Graham](https://dawngraham.github.io/)

## Problem Statement
Timebanking can help individual and community needs be met without relying on money, markets, or the state. What are the best predictors of a successful and active timebank?

## Goal
I will build a regression model to predict the number of weekly exchanges in timebanks using the TimeBanks.org platform.
