"7 Dickens St, Addington",New Zealand,,"Addington TimeBank: Serving Southern Christchurch and Beyond   MOTTO Swapping Skills, Connecting Communities   MISSION To foster relationship building, increasing connectedness among people, regenerating community and meeting real needs of our community members by shifting thinking beyond money ­based trading. VALUES Addington TimeBank values individual skills; fostering sharing and support; learning both give and take; building trust and responsibility; building local sustainability and resilience.    ""The mission of TimeBanks in general is to nurture and expand a movement that promotes equality and builds caring community economies through inclusive exchange of time and talent. TimeBanks aim to achieve wide ­ranging goals such as social justice, bridges between diverse communities, and local ecological sustainability.                        ● Assets:  We are all assets. We all have something to give. ● Redefining Work ­ Some work is beyond price.  Work has to be redefined to value whatever it takes to raise healthy children, build strong families, revitalize neighborhoods, make democracy work, advance social justice, make the planet sustainable. That kind of work needs to be honored, recorded and rewarded. ● Reciprocity:  ­ Helping works better as a two ­way street.  The question: “How can I help you?” needs to change so we ask: “How can we help each other build the world we both will live in?” ● Social Networks: ­ We need each other.  Networks are stronger than individuals. People helping each other reweave communities of support, strength & trust. Community is built upon sinking roots, building trust, creating networks. Special relationships are built on commitment. ● Respect ­ Every human being:  Respect underlies freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and everything we value. Respect supplies the heart and soul of democracy. When respect is denied to anyone, we all are injured. We must respect where people are in the moment, not where we hope they will be at some future point."" Taken from <http://timebanks.org/about>   VISION Addington Timebank weaves networks among groups and individuals within our community.    Safety",Addington TimeBank,"This TimeBank became live on 1 February 2012.  We have been working on its development since October 2011.  The TimeBank has members who are individuals, families who share an email address, and local groups or organisations.  The development has been made possible because of the work of various  agencies and community groups within Addington.  We welcome members from anywhere but expect that most of our members will be from the Southern and Western suburbs of Christchurch - with a particular focus on Addington, of course.  We are particularly keen to involve members of our community in our development over the next two months as we register our members on this site and get used to trading.  Then for the celebration - we are launching our TimeBank with a working bee and fun day at St Mary's in Church Square Addington on 24 March 2012.

Brattleboro Time Trade enables the exchange of time credits, a type of community currency that anyone can earn by using their time, resources, skills or energy to help others. Each hour of service provided to another Time Trade member earns one time credit. You can spend your time credits on  services provided by any of the other members of the Time Trade.   Our Mission Brattleboro Time Trade provides a forum to facilitate the exchange of goods and services for the benefit of the community. It creates a system that connects unmet needs with untapped resources. By promoting the skills and knowledge of each member and enabling reciprocity, the organization empowers each of us to share our wealth of experience with others, thereby enriching the local economy.   We share the Core Values of Time Banks throughout the world:   1. Assets We all have ways to contribute to a healthy community, even when we may not feel we have marketable skills. By recognizing that each of us has valuable assets to offer we are able to address some of today’s unmet needs by using the untapped resources available in our own communities. 2. Redefining Work Honor real work that is beyond price. Long before there was an economy based on paper money, folks worked gathering and preparing food, making shelter, keeping each other safe and healthy. This is real work that has real value that can’t and needn’t be measured in dollars. 3. Reciprocity Helping works better as a two-way street. People that only receive end up feeling dis-empowered, as though they have nothing to offer. People that only give often gain an inflated sense of their own importance. Reciprocity leads to mutual respect. 4. Community Networks and community make individuals stronger. Research shows people with social support networks have a greater overall sense of well being which correlates with enhanced health. Strong communities are able to adapt to challenging times. 5.

The Timebank is a simple, money-free, community building, alternative means of exchange, that recognizes value in every individual thereby strengthening the fabric of our community.  The Hour 4 Our World Time Exchange has three main goals:  Serve people and give them a means to serve. Strengthen the fabric of our community. Establish new relationships and meet real needs of our community members.  We recognize that each person has talents to share, and that the overall community is strengthened when neighbors help one another. For every hour that you help meet the needs of another member, you earn a time credit for the exchange. This time credit can then be redeemed for services from others, and the never-ending cycle of sharing continues. Core Values of TimeBanking Assets: We are all assets. Everyone has something to contribute. Work: Some work is beyond price. Work must be redefined to value whatever it takes to raise healthy children, build strong families, revitalize neighborhoods, make democracy work, advance social justice, and make the planet sustainable. That kind of work needs to be honored, recorded and rewarded. Reciprocity: Helping works better as a two-way street. The question: How can I help you? Needs to change so we ask: “How can we help each other build the world we both will live in?” Social Networks: We need each other. People helping each other reweave communities of support, strength and trust. Community is built upon sinking roots, building trust, creating networks that are built on mutual respect and commitment. Respect: Respect demands accountability. The voices of all must be heard and heeded so as to promote social justices and compel accountability",Hour 4 Our World,,816-256-3818,"Pleasant Valley, Missouri 64068",timebanks/hour-4-our-world,,hour4ourworld,http://hour4ourworld.timebanks.org,
